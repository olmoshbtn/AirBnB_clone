## AirBnB clone
This project aims to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website. We won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

At the end, we will have a complete web application composed by:

* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and our data

### 1. The command interpreter
* how to start it
* how to use it
* examples
